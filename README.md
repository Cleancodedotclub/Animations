CSS Animation is a collection of CSS code snippets that provide animation effects for different user interactions on a web page. The repository includes code for three types of CSS animations:

Hover Animation: This animation effect triggers when the user hovers over an element on a web page. It can be used to highlight or draw attention to certain elements, such as buttons or links. The repository includes several hover animation effects that can be customized for different use cases.

Submit Button Animation: This animation effect is triggered when the user submits a form on a web page. It provides visual feedback to the user that their form submission is being processed. The repository includes several submit button animation effects that can be customized for different form styles.

Three Dot Loading Animation: This animation effect is commonly used to indicate that a page or element is loading or processing. It displays a set of three dots that blink in sequence to create the appearance of loading. The repository includes several variations of the three dot loading animation that can be customized for different loading scenarios.

These CSS animations can be easily integrated into any web page or application, and customized to fit the design and branding of the website. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
